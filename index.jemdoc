== About me
I am currently a second-year Phd student affiliated with Division of Decision and Control Systems (DCS) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I am fortunate to jointly work with [https://people.kth.se/~kallej/ *Prof. Karl H. Johansson*] at KTH and [https://www.michaelmzavlanos.org/ *Prof. Michael M. Zavlanos*] at Duke University. Before that, I received both the master and bachelor degrees at Honors School of Harbin Institute of Technology under the supervision of [http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wuligang *Prof. Ligang Wu*]. 

== Research
My research interests lie broadly in the span of {{<font color="Blue" size=+0.5><b>}}control theory, game theory, optimization and machine learning {{</b></font>}}as well as their applications. Some of my recent research projects include risk-averse and distributional robust optimization.
