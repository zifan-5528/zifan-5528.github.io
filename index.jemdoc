== About me
I am a second-year Phd student affiliated with Division of Decision and Control Systems (DCS) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I am fortunate to jointly work with [https://people.kth.se/~kallej/ Prof. Karl H. Johansson] at KTH and [https://www.michaelmzavlanos.org/ Prof. Michael M. Zavlanos] at Duke University. I received my master degree and bachelor degree both at Harbin Institute of Technology under the supervision of [http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wuligang Prof. Ligang Wu]. 

== Research
My research interests lie broadly in the span of control theory, game theory, optimization and machine learning as well as their applications. I am also interested in risk-averse/distributional learning.
