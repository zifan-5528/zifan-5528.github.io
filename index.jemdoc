== About me
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student affiliated with Division of Decision and Control Systems (DCS) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I am fortunate to jointly work with [https://people.kth.se/~kallej/ Prof. Karl H. Johansson] at KTH and [https://www.michaelmzavlanos.org/ Prof. Michael M. Zavlanos] at Duke University. Before that, I received both the master and bachelor degrees at Honors School of Harbin Institute of Technology. 

I am currently visiting [https://las.inf.ethz.ch/ Learning & Adaptive Systems Group] at ETH Zurich, hosted by [https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea Prof. Andreas Krause]. Look forward to the discussions and meetings in Zurich!

== Research
I am broadly interested in the intersection of {{<font color="Blue" size=+0.5><b>}}control{{</b></font>}}, {{<font color="Blue" size=+0.5><b>}}machine learning{{</b></font>}}, {{<font color="Blue" size=+0.5><b>}}optimal transport{{</b></font>}}, and {{<font color="Blue" size=+0.5><b>}}game theory{{</b></font>}}. I have worked on research topics including distributionally robust optimization, CVaR optimization, distributional reinforcement learning in LQR, decision-dependent optimization. Lately, I have been exploring generative models with a special focus on flow matching models.
