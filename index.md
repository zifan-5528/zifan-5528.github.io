### Biography
I am pursuing the Phd degree with Prof. Michael Zavlanos at Duke University since 2021. Before that, I obtained the master degree and bachelor degree both at Harbin Institute of Technology (Honors School) with the degree of control science and engineering, at 2019 and 2021 respectively.

In August 2019, I studied at the University of Cambridge in a short-term study program.
